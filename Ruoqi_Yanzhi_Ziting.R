#SECTION 1: Run regressions with control variables (X) and fixed effects using "felm" function

#  Standard syntax for the felm function is as follows.
#  felm(log(Q) ~ log(P) + X | factor(name of the categorical variables for fixed effects), data source)  


#With no fixed effects, the syntax is identical to the default "lm" function.
#Your colleague's regression
reg=felm(log(qu)~log(eurpr), data=cardata)
summary(reg)

#Questions:
#1. What is the interpretation of the regression result (e.g. intercept and coefficient)?

#Intercept (11.2904): This represents the log of the expected quantity sold when the price is at its baseline level (1 Euro in this case). 
#However, given the nature of logarithmic models, this value is more of a theoretical construct and may not have a practical, real-world interpretation.
#Coefficient for log(eurpr) (-0.2925): This coefficient indicates the price elasticity of demand. It means that for a 1% increase in the price, 
#the quantity sold is expected to decrease by approximately 0.2925%. This negative value reflects the inverse relationship between price and demand in this context.

#2. β1 estimate from this regression is likely not causal. Explain why.

#Example of adding controls: run a log-log regression with "year" as 
#fixed effect and "li" as a control variable
reg2=felm(log(qu) ~ log(eurpr)+li | factor(ye), data=cardata)
summary(reg2)

#We can add multiple FE separately, or interact them. This is how we add two separate fixed effects
#one for each year (same value across all car models) and the other for each car model (same value across all years)
reg3_1=felm(log(qu)~log(eurpr)+li | factor(ye)+factor(co), data=cardata)
summary(reg3_1)

#This is how we add interacting fixed effects for "each year-car model combination" - use ":" instead of "+".
#Note the difference between 3_1 and 3_2 (run both and check what FE is included using "getfe" below). Here
#each car model - year combination gets assigned a unique value of FE.
reg3_2=felm(log(qu)~log(eurpr)+li | factor(ye):factor(co), data=cardata)
summary(reg3_2)


#Note that unlike default "lm", "felm" function does not provide estimates of 
#the intercepts and fixed effects. To get those numbers, we use "getfe" function.

fe=getfe(reg3_2)

#getfe function produces all values for fixed effects as a list.

#Say we want to get the fixed effect value for year 1990. We need to
#find the right location of the list.

#Find where it is located - use "match" function.
idc <- match('90',fe$idx)
fe90=fe[idc,1]
#fe90 is the value of fixed effect for year 1990.

#If you included interactive fixed effects (reg3_2 above), you need
#to specify both the year and market to find the value of the corresponding
#fixed effect.
fe2=getfe(reg3_2)

#Say you want to find the value of FE for year 1990 in market 3.
idc <- match('90.3',fe2$idx)
fe90_3=fe[idc,1]

#Another example use of "getfe" function is available in topic 1 
#R code around line 200.


#For presenting results:
#Unfortunately, some shortcut functionalities to present results from the standard "lm" 
#won't work for the felm - like "predict" function won't work.
#Hence, drawing figures of felm outcome requires the use of generic plot functions. 

#An example:
#Take estimated coefficients from the regression above.
coef2=reg3_2$coefficients

#Take the space of prices to plot against the demand
pricespace=seq(0,50000,100)

#Calculate predicted demand at each price point, evaluated in year 1990 in market 3, for a 
#car with an average value of li.
fitted=(exp(fe90_3+coef2[1]*log(pricespace)+coef2[2]*mean(cardata$li)))

#Plot the line against the raw data.
plot(cardata$eurpr,cardata$qu, pch=1, main="Price vs Sales",
     xlab="Price", ylab="Sales", cex=2,cex.lab=1.5, cex.axis=1.5, cex.main=1.5, cex.sub=1.5)
lines(pricespace,fitted,col="blue",lwd=2)

#SECTION 2: Run an IV regression using "felm" function

#Examples of using an IV: 
# The syntax of felm function with an IV is as follows:

# felm(log(Q)~ X | factor(name of the categorical variable for FE) | (log(P)~ Z), data source) 

# "(log(P)~ Z)" part represents "we instrument log(P) with Z".
# Z is our IV for log(P). Importantly, if you instrument for log(P),
# we need to drop log(P) from the first part of the code.


#Run a log-log regression with "ye" as 
#fixed effect, "li" as a control variable and "we" as an
#IV for log(P). 
reg4=felm(log(qu)~li | factor(ye) | (log(eurpr)~we), data=cardata)
summary(reg4)

#Example of using an IV: if we don't include any X variable in
#an IV regression, simply place "1" in place of X.
reg5=felm(log(qu)~1 | factor(ye) | (log(eurpr)~we), data=cardata)
summary(reg5)

#Example of using an IV: if we don't include fixed effects in 
#an IV regression, place "0" in place of factor variable.
reg6=felm(log(qu)~li | 0 | (log(eurpr)~we), data=cardata)
summary(reg6)

#Example of using an IV: if we need to instrument for more than one
#variables, here's how.
#This is an example where we instrument "log(eurpr)" and "log(avgurprrival)" in
#our regression with instruments "we" and "do" (doesn't mean this is 
#the right combination). Note that if we want to
#instrument for two variables, we need at least two Z variables (generally, the
#number of Z variables needs to be equal to or larger than the number of variables
#that need to be instrumented).
reg7=felm(log(qu)~li | 0 | (log(eurpr)| log(avgurprrival) ~ we + do) ,data=cardata)
summary(reg7)
